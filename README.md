# Netlify Dummy Site

Netlify doesn't seem to support any other way to create a new site except these:

- Import from existing project (setting up Github links & whatnot)
- Use a template (setting up god-knows-what from the template)
- Drop a folder with content (just put what you have in a folder on disk)

We want Netlify to have as little to do with deploying as possible - our CI will do everything. Because of that the 1st & 2nd option are in the way.

3rd option is OK, as this will be just a temporary site until the project's CI kicks in.

But where to find a decent folder with a dummy file?

Look no further! ðŸ¤ª
